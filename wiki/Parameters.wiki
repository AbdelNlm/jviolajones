#summary Description of the parameters of the detectFaces function.

= Introduction =

Once you have created a detector by loading an OpenCV XML file that way
{{{
Detector detector = new Detector("PathtoXMLfile.xml");
}}}

you may detect objects (such as faces) on an image by calling the detectFaces function, which returns a List`<Rectangle>` containing the rectangles identified as faces on the image.


= Signature =

The complete signature of the detectFaces function is the following :
{{{
public List<java.awt.Rectangle> getFaces(String file,float baseScale, float scale_inc,float increment, int min_neighbors,boolean doCannyPruning)
}}}
where the parameters mean the following :
  * _file_ : the image to work on
  * _baseScale_
